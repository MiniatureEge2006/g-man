Command parameters surrounded by <> are required, [] are optional.

Some commands may be listed as having multiple names, this means they are the same command.<br>
Example: `!saturate 5` is the same as `!saturation 5`<br>

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| amplify | `!amplify [amount] [radius]` | amount: `0 to 65535`<br><br>radius: `1 to 63` | Makes pixels more colorful the more they change. A higher `[amount]` makes the pixels more colorful, with a default value of 6.<br><br>`[radius]` determines how many adjacent frames each frame looks at to consider how much a pixel has changed by. By default the value is 1.<br><br>NOTE: a higher `[radius]` causes more frames to drop at the start and end of the video. | `!amplify 15`<br><br>`!amplify 15 30`
| audioblend<br>audiomerge | `!audioblend` | | Blends the audio in the second to most recent video with the audio from the most recent video. | `!audioblend` |

| bitcrush | `!bitcrush [samples] [bits]` | `1 to inf`<br>`1 to inf` | Bitcrushes the audio. By default, `[samples]` is 32 and `[bits]` is 2. Higher values make a more crushed sound. | `!bitcrush`<br><br>`!bitcrush 64`<br><br>`!bitcrush 8 8` |
| blur | `!blur <amount>` | `1 - 127` | Blurs the video. `[amount]` represents the radius of the blur around each pixel, with a default of 10. | `!blur`<br><br>`!blur 15` |
| brightness | `!brightness [amount]` | `-1 to 1` | Adjusts the brightness of a video, with a default `[amount]` of 1. | `!brightness`<br><br>`!brightness 0.5` |

| equalize<br>equalizer | `!equalize [b1] [b2] ... [b17] [b18]` | `0 to inf` | 18 band equalizer. More information here: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#superequalizer<br>You can provide a number for each frequency band. If you don't provide a value, or set a value as -1, it is set to a random number between 0 and 20. | `!equalize`<br><br>`!equalize 10 10 -1 5 5 0 0` |
| extract | `!extract <start_time> <end_time>`<br><br>`!extract <duration>` | | Extracts the clip between `<start_time>` and `<end_time>`. Time can be specified in seconds (ex: `5` or `7.1`) or minutes:seconds (ex: `0:03` or `1:24.8`). You can also use `start` or `end` to specify the start or end of the video.<br><br>A shortcut for extracts starting at 0 is to provide just one number as a `<duration>`, meaning `!extract 0 1:15` is the same as `!extract 1:15`.<br><br>Secret trick: you can do `!extract 5 10 as really cool video` to extract between 5 and 10 seconds, save the extraction as "really cool video" to your bookmarks, and repost the original video. | `!extract 5`<br><br>`!extract 5 10`<br><br>`!extract 30 1:00`<br><br>`!extract 5 end` |

Without any parameters, `#00FF00` is used as the greenscreen `[color]`, and 0.7 as the `[sensitivity]`.<br><br>`[color]` can be specified as a hexcode starting with #, or as the name of a color (see https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-utils.html#Color).<br><br>`[sensitivity]` specifies how similar a pixel has to be to `[color]` to become transparent. | `!greenscreen`<br><br>`!greenscreen #0000ff`<br><br>`!greenscreen LightGreen 0.9` |

| invert<br>inverse<br>negate<br>negative | `!invert` | | Inverts the video's colors. | `!invert` |
| lagfun | `!lagfun [amount]` | `0 to 1` | Makes darker pixels update slower. This can create an interesting smearing effect with lighter pixels. A higher `[amount]` makes the smearing last longer, with a value of 1 causing bright colors to never disappear. Values close to 0.96 create very noticable results. Default value is 0.96. | `!lagfun`<br><br>`!lagfun 0.99` |

| pitch | `!pitch [amount]` | `More than 0` | Multiplies the pitch by `[amount]`, with a default of 2. There is also a `!semitone` command to offset the pitch by a number of semitones. | `!pitch`<br><br>`!pitch 0.5` |
| retro | `!retro [color_count]` | `1 to 255` | Reduces the number of colors in the video by making each RGB channel have `[color_count]` shades, with a default of 4.<br><br>Note that this doesn't reduce the total number of possible colors to `[color_count]`. Example: `[color_count]`=4 makes red have 4 shades, green have 4 shades, and blue have 4 shades, meaning there's actually 64 possible colors. | `!retro`<br><br>`!retro 2` |
| rotate | `!rotate [radians]` | `-inf to inf` | Rotates the video by `[radians]` radians. Default value is `t`.<br><br>You can use expressions supported by FFMPEG to create an animated rotation.

| rotatedeg | `!rotatedeg [degrees]` | `-inf to inf` | Rotates the video by `[degrees]` degrees. Default value is 45 degrees.<br>Expressions are not supported, see `!rotate` if you wish to use them. | `!rotatedeg`<br><br>`!rotatedeg 180` |
| saturate<br>saturation | `!saturate [amount]` | `-10 to 10` | Saturates the video, with a default `[amount]` of 10. | `!saturate 2` |
| scale<br>size | `!scale [width] [height]` | `50 to 1240` | Scales the video. You can preserve the aspect ratio by setting `[width]` or `[height]` to auto. By default, `[width]` is 480 and `<height>` is auto. | `!scale 640 480`<br><br>`!scale 240`<br><br>`!scale auto 720` |
| scroll | `!scroll [horizontal] [vertical]` | `-100 to 100` | Makes the video scroll with a default `[horizontal]` speed of 1 and `[vertical]` speed of 0. Speed describes how much of the video should scroll every frame (example: horizontal speed of 5 = video scrolls horizontally by 5% of its width every frame). | `!scroll`<br><br>`!scroll 5`<br><br>`!scroll 0 4` |
| semitone | `!semitone [semitone]` | `-inf to inf` | Same as `!pitch`, except pitch offset is specified in semitones. Default `[semitone]` value is 12. | `!semitone`<br><br>`!semitone 7` |
| shader | `!shader <x_equation> <y_equation>` | `Any valid equation works` | Advanced command that is a shortcut for the geq filter in FFMpeg. This command is equivalent to running `!filter geq r=r(x_equation,y_equation) g=g(x_equation,y_equation) b=b(x_equation,y_equation)` | `!shader mod(X+T*3,W) mod(Y+20*sin(T*5),H)`<br><br>`!shader X+20*sin(T*5+X*0.01) Y+20*cos(T*5+Y*0.01)` |

# Advanced
## !filter command
EXPERIMENTAL: You can apply almost any filter from FFMPEG using the !filter command. At the moment, filters requiring two or more videos will not work.<br> You can get a link to all the filters in FFMPEG by typing `!filter help`.
* Format: `!filter <filter_name> <filter_args>`
* `<filter_args>` are formatted in this way: `arg1_name=arg1_value arg2_name=arg2_value ...`
* Examples:
    * `!filter aecho`
    * `!filter edgedetect low=0.1 mode=wires`
    * `!filter drawtext text="g_man was here" x="(main_w-tw)/2" y="(main_h-th)/2 + 100*sin(t*6)" fontsize=50`
* Multiple filters can be applied with one message by simply appending another `!filter <filter_name> <filter_args>`
* Examples:
    * `!filter reverse !filter areverse`
    * `!filter eq contrast=1.2 !filter hue h=60 enable=gte(t,3) !filter negate`
