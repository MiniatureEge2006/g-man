# Rise and shine. Mr. Freeman. Rise. And. Shine.
**This project is a fork of the original g_man bot. (https://github.com/nkrasn/g_man) So credits to nkrasn for making this bot.**

# G-Man
A Discord multi-purpose bot.

## Features
* Slash commands with user install support.
* Simple media editing commands.
* A block/allowlisting system along with bot owners being able to globally block users or servers.
* A command block/allowlisting system that works similar to the block and allowlist system.
* Many information commands.
  * Such as userinfo, channelinfo, and serverinfo (there's more of course.)
* A reminder system.
* A YouTube search command.
* Music commands with FFMPEG audio filters support along with a queue system.
* A prefix changing system.
* An AI chatbot command via Ollama.
* Code execution server and command that includes custom packages like yt-dlp, ffmpeg, etc.
* And lastly, a tag system with tagscripting support.

## Usage/Commands
You can now just type `g-help` in a channel to see all the commands.

## Requirements
* The FFMPEG binary/executable, and YT-DLP package from pip (remember, not the executable for yt-dlp)
* Ollama
* Docker
* A PostgreSQL database
  * see the `setup.sql` file and run the query. This is required for the prefix, command/bot block/allowlisting system, reminder system, and tags.
* All the Python packages in requirements.txt

You can install the Python packages, preferably in a virtual environment, by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Tip:* If you're using Mac or Linux, you may have Python 2/Pip 2 preinstalled. You should run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
<br> If the pip installation didn't work, try to install the packages seperately because I suck at finding a good compatible version for the requirements.txt file.
## Installation
* Download/install all requirements.
* Set up these folders with the following contents (if a folder doesn't exist, create it):
  * vids
    * Keep this folder empty as its contents are often deleted.
* Create a copy of `bot_info_template.json` and rename it to `bot_info.json`. Fill it in with the appropriate information (keep the quotes).
* Go to the g-coder directory and run `docker-compose up -d --build` to set up the code execution server.
  * Code execution server's port is 8000.
* Run `py gman.py` (or if you are on Linux/macOS, `python3 gman.py`)
